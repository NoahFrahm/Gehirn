Inputs ->
-key inputs (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
-current piece (there are seven possible tetriminos)
  - each with 4 rotations
-next piece (seven possible pieces)
-locked status of all tiles (only tiles covered by old placed down tetriminos).
 this is a 10 X 20 grid, with four points being reserved for our current piece (these are considered unlocked) and the
 remaining points having a value of 0 as unlocked or 1 as locked



Outputs -> 
-key moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

Activation Function ->
-play around with different activation functions and document results
-tanh or sigmoid (since we are using a ___ neural network?)

Population size ->
-10
-50
-100

Fitness Function -> 
-points (our metric of success)
-points scored
  - placing a piece
  - clearing a line
  - suriving longer/getting to higher levels (higher levels automatically create score multiplier)


Max generations ->
-200
-50


Different Models ->
-we will consider 3 training approaches for our model
  -the first will involve only passing in current piece data and nothing about the 
  current state of the grid (what tiles are filled in, this is 2 input neurons)
  -the second will involve  passing in piece data and next piece data (this is 4 input neurons)
  -the third will pass in current piece, next piece, and grid state (this is 204 input neurons)



Notes
- making sure training used same random seed improved model greatly
- should make piece fitness boost constant and emphasize line clears as high value
- add hidden nodes

TODO: figure out our population size and max generations
