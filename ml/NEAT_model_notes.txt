Inputs ->
-key inputs (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
-current piece (there are seven possible tetriminos)
-next piece (seven possible pieces)
-locked status of all tiles (only tiles covered by old placed down tetriminos).
 this is a 10 X 20 grid, with four points being reserved for our current piece (these are considered unlocked) and the
 remaining points having a value of 0 as unlocked or 1 as locked
-points (our metric of success)


Outputs -> 
-key moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

Activation Function ->
-play around with different activation functions and document results
-tanh or sigmoid (since we are using a Recurrent neural network)

Population size ->
-10
-50
-100

Fitness Function -> 
-points scored

Max generations ->
-200
